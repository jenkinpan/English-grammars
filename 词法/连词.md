连词是连接单词、短语、从句或句子的虚词，用于表达逻辑关系（如并列、转折、因果等）。以下是初中阶段需要掌握的连词知识点：

---

#### **一、连词的分类**
连词分为 **并列连词** 和 **从属连词** 两大类，另有一些 **关联连词** 和 **连接副词** 需注意。

---

#### **二、并列连词（Coordinating Conjunctions）**
用于连接 **对等的成分**（单词、短语、分句），常见的有 **FANBOYS** 口诀：
- **F**or（表原因，较正式）
- **A**nd（表并列或递进）
- **N**or（表否定并列，“也不”）
- **B**ut（表转折）
- **O**r（表选择或否则）
- **Y**et（表转折，类似but但更强调对比）
- **S**o（表结果）

**用法规则**：
1. **连接两个独立分句**时，需在连词前加 **逗号**：
   - I studied hard, **and** I passed the exam.  
   - She likes apples, **but** her brother prefers bananas.

2. **连接单词或短语**时，无需逗号：
   - I bought apples **and** oranges.  
   - He can swim **or** dive.

3. **否定并列**用 **nor**，需倒装：
   - She doesn’t like coffee, **nor does she** drink tea.

#### **三、从属连词（Subordinating Conjunctions）**
用于引导 **从句**，表明主从句间的逻辑关系（时间、原因、条件等）。常见从属连词：

| **类型** | **常见连词**                             | **例句**                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **时间** | when, while, after, before, since, until | **When** it rains, I stay at home.          |
| **条件** | if, unless, as long as                   | **If** you study, you will succeed.         |
| **原因** | because, since, as                       | I stayed home **because** I was sick.       |
| **让步** | although, though, even if                | **Although** it was cold, we went out.      |
| **目的** | so that, in order that                   | She studied hard **so that** she could win. |
| **结果** | so...that, such...that                   | It was **so** hot **that** we melted.       |

**注意**：
- 从句可位于主句前或后，从句在前时需加逗号：
  - **Because he was late**, he missed the bus.  
  - He missed the bus **because he was late**.

---

#### **四、关联连词（Correlative Conjunctions）**
成对使用，连接对等成分，需注意 **主谓一致**：

| **连词**               | **用法**                | **例句**                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| both...and...          | 两者都（连接肯定）      | **Both** Tom **and** Jerry are funny.        |
| either...or...         | 要么...要么（二选一）   | **Either** you **or** I am wrong.            |
| neither...nor...       | 既不...也不（全否定）   | **Neither** he **nor** she knows the answer. |
| not only...but also... | 不仅...而且（强调后者） | She **not only** sings **but also** dances.  |

**主谓一致规则**：动词单复数由 **靠近的主语** 决定。  
- Either the teacher **or** the students **are** responsible.  
- Not only the students **but also** the teacher **is** excited.

---

#### **五、连接副词（Conjunctive Adverbs）**
虽非严格连词，但起连接作用，需搭配标点使用：

| **常见词** | 作用 | **例句**                                     |
| ---------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------- |
| however    | 转折 | It rained; **however**, we still went out.   |
| therefore  | 因果 | He was tired; **therefore**, he slept early. |
| moreover   | 递进 | She is smart; **moreover**, she works hard.  |

**标点规则**：连接两个独立句时，用 **分号** + 连接副词 + **逗号**。

---

#### **六、易错点与注意事项**
1. **连词重复**：  
   - ❌ Although it was raining, **but** we went out.  
   - ✅ Although it was raining, we went out.  
     （或：It was raining, **but** we went out.）

2. **连词与标点**：  
   - ❌ I like apples **and**, I hate bananas.  
   - ✅ I like apples, **but** I hate bananas.

3. **so 与 because 不连用**：  
   - ❌ **Because** I was tired, **so** I slept.  
   - ✅ **Because** I was tired, I slept.  
     （或：I was tired, **so** I slept.）

4. **主谓一致**（关联连词）：  
   - ❌ Neither the cat **nor** the dog **are** hungry.  
   - ✅ Neither the cat **nor** the dog **is** hungry.

#### **七、练习题（自测）**
1. **填空**：用合适连词连接句子。  
   a. He wanted to play soccer. It was raining.  
   → He wanted to play soccer, ______ it was raining.  
   b. You can stay here. You can leave.  
   → You can ______ stay here ______ leave.

2. **改错**：  
   a. She not only speaks English but also French.  
   b. Because he was late, so he missed the bus.

3. **造句**：用 **unless** 和 **so that** 各造一个复合句。

---

2. a. She speaks **not only** English **but also** French.  
   b. **Because** he was late, he missed the bus.
